Sensor Data Collector Backend
==============================

This is the Python package for the backend API.

HOW IT'S ORGANIZED:
------------------
- models/    = Data structures (what does a sensor look like?)
- services/  = Workers (actually fetch data, talk to sensors)
- routers/   = API endpoints (the doors into our app)
- main.py    = Puts it all together and starts the server
